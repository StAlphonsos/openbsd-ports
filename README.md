# OpenBSD Ports #

These are ports I'm working on.  It can get pretty rough in here and I
make no bones about it: I frequently rename things or just get rid of
them if they aren't going anywhere.  If you're actually interested in
any of this you should probably contact me:
http://trac.haqistan.net/~attila has contact info.

I keep notes in notes.org.  You're welcome to look over my shoulder
but don't be offended by what I say, then...

## Note on Tor Browser ##

The Tor browser port work has moved to https://github.com/torbsd
The [openbsd-ports](https://github.com/torbsd/openbsd-ports) repository
is the new home of all TBB-on-OpenBSD ports work.
