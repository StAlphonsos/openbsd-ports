From the README:

MultiMarkdown is a derivative of Markdown that adds new syntax
features, such as footnotes, tables, and metadata. Additionally, it
offers mechanisms to convert plain text into LaTeX in addition to
HTML.

MultiMarkdown started as a Perl script, which was modified from the
original Markdown.pl.

MultiMarkdown v3 (aka 'peg-multimarkdown') was based on John
MacFarlane's peg-markdown.  It used a parsing expression grammar
(PEG), and was written in C in order to compile on almost any
operating system.  Thanks to work by Daniel Jalkut, MMD v3 was built
so that it didn't have any external library requirements.

MultiMarkdown v4 is basically a complete rewrite of v3.  It uses the
same basic PEG for parsing (Multi)Markdown text, but otherwise is
almost completely rebuilt.
