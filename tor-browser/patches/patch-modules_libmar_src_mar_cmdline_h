- * Verifies a MAR file by verifying each signature with the corresponding

- * certificates given, and all signature verifications must succeed.
- * This is only used by the signmar program when used with arguments to verify 
- * a MAR. This should not be used to verify a MAR that will be extracted in the 
- * same operation by updater code. This function prints the error message if 
- * verification fails.
